ShareAI is like any other social media app. Users are able to make a personal account, expand their network of friends, 
and send images to people in their friend group. Users first can upload the image to their account to be stored on the cloud 
database associated to them. Then users can press a button that runs a facial recognition to detect the set of friends the 
picture needs to be sent to. Once the user hits send, the images are sent to the set of friends recognized.
